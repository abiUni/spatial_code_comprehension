        <h2>Code Navigation and Annotation Tasks</h2>
        <h4>Overview:</h4>

        <p>
            Next, you will be looking at the source code of the Flutter Folio App.<br><br> The Flutter project will be opened in the code documentation tool introduced previously.<br><br> You will be asked to complete three tasks, in which you will navigate
            through the code base and annotate certain code lines.<br><br> Each task comprises two parts:
            <ul style="width: 1200px;">
                <li> The first part is a <b><i>navigation part</i></b> where you are asked to trace and annotate a given feature throughout the code (example from user interaction to data change).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> The second part is a <b><i>comprehension part</i></b> where you are either asked to find and annotate the code line(s) responsible for a certain bug affecting the feature you traced or to annotate the lines where a certain logic is implemented.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Please answer as accurately as possible and try to annotate as many relevant code sections as possible.<br> If you get stuck on a task, you can skip to the next task by clicking "Continue". You cannot go back to the previous task.<br><br>We
            encourage you to attempt all tasks.<br><br> Please use the <b>participant ID</b> assigned to you (see invitation email) to login to the tool on the next page.<br><br> Good Luck! </p>

        <p style="color:rgb(186, 34, 34);"><b>Reminder of Tool Controls:</b><br><br><b> Use trackpad or <i>scrollwheel</i> (press scrollwheel to drag) for movements on the canvas.<br><br> Zoom-in/zoom-out works using <i>scrollwheel</i>+<kbd>alt</kbd> or <i>scrollwheel</i> + <kbd>option ⌥</kbd> on mac. <br><br>Using the trackpad keep <kbd>alt</kbd> or <kbd>option ⌥</kbd>  pressed while moving your fingers over the trackpad to zoom in and out of the canvas.</b>
