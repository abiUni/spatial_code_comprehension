        <h1>Online Study on Visualisation for Code Understanding</h1>

        <p>Dear Participant,<br><br> Thank you for your interest in our experiment! <br> We are investigating code visualisations to help developers with code comprehension and navigation.<br> We are very grateful that you're helping us by participating
            in this experiment.
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment Overview:</h3>
        <p>
            In this experiment, we will ask you to solve three tasks in which you will be searching through a given code base, the Flutter Folio App, and annotating relevant code lines. A web application for code documentation will be used to visualise the code.
            We will then ask you to take a cognitive memory task and finally to compelete a survey including demographics and an evaluation of the code documentation tool.<br><br>
            <b>Please note that for legal reasons you are only allowed to partcipate in the experiment if you are 18 years or older.</b>
        </p>

        <p>With this experiment:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>we compare the outcome of the three code searching tasks under different circumstances</li>
                <li>we log the interactions with the tool (annotation events, file interactions, etc) during the tasks to better understand which features are helpful</li>
                <li>your data will only be stored and used in anonymized form</li>
                <li>you will get the chance to win one Voucher</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The code you will be searching through (Flutter Folio App) is a project using the Flutter framework, so basic Dart skills are sufficient.<br><br> Please stay focused on the experiment until it ends, otherwise we won't be able to use your data.
            <br><br> Please make sure you have at least <b>one hour</b> free to do the experiment.<br><br> Please don't interrupt the experiment for longer periods of time once you've started.<br><br> You are free to leave the experiment at any time,
            your participation will then not be counted.<br><br> For optimum experience, we recommend keeping your browser window as large as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Protection Notice:</h3>
        <p>The data gathered in this experiment will be used solely for research purposes and will not be made available to any third party. The participation in this study is voluntary and the participants can leave the experiment at any time. The data
            of each participant will be anonymized using an identification number. Each participant is invited to provide their email adress if they wish to take part in the voucher lottery, no trace link will be made between email adresses and identification
            numbers of the experiment. The scientific results of the experiment will be published under full anonymity for the participants.
        </p>

        <h3>Declaration of Consent:</h3>
        <p>By pressing "Start", I agree that I have read and understood the data protection notice and the experiment information and that I voluntarily take part in this experiment.<br><br> Thank you and we hope you enjoy participating in our study!
        </p>

        <p>Please contact (first author) or (second author) in case you encounter any problems with the experiment.</p>

        <button onclick="open_page();">Start â–º</button>

        <p> Participants that take part multiple times or otherwise try to fake results will be excluded from the lottery.
